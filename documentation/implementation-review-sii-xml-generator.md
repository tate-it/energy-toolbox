  - Tooltips with additional context
  - Conditional requirement explanations

## 2. Technical Architecture Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized component structure with clear separation of concerns
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types matching SII specification
3. **Testing**: Good test coverage for components and utilities
4. **State Management**: Effective use of NuQS for URL-based state persistence
5. **Validation**: Robust Zod schemas with Italian error messages

### Weaknesses

1. **Complex Conditional Logic**: Some conditional rules from Section 8 of PRD not fully implemented
2. **Error Recovery**: Limited handling of corrupted URL state
3. **Performance**: No lazy loading or code splitting for large components
4. **Documentation**: Missing inline documentation for complex business rules

## 3. Specific Implementation Gaps

### 3.1 Conditional Rules (PRD Section 8)

Missing implementations:

```typescript
// Example: ComponenteImpresa rules for Gas market
// Required: At least one IntervalloPrezzi for each ComponenteImpresa
// Current: No validation enforcing this rule

// Example: Early withdrawal charges date restriction
// Required: TIPOLOGIA_CONDIZIONE = 05 only after January 1, 2024
// Current: No date-based validation
```

### 3.2 Field Dependencies

Not fully implemented:
- FasceOrarieSettimanale inheritance for TIPOLOGIA_FASCE = 03 or 07
- Component pricing rules based on MACROAREA and UNITA_MISURA combinations
- Discount validity period vs VALIDITA field mutual exclusivity

### 3.3 XML Structure

Issues found:
- No validation against XSD schema before download
- Missing element ordering validation

## 4. Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Implement Missing Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Add Command/Ctrl + Arrow key handlers for step navigation
   - Ensure proper focus management

2. **Complete Conditional Field Logic**
   - Implement all rules from PRD Section 8
   - Add comprehensive tests for conditional scenarios

3. **XML Validation Enhancement**
   - Add validation against XSD schema before download
   - Implement element ordering validation

4. **Enhance User Assistance**
   - Add tooltips for complex fields
   - Provide format examples inline
   - Explain conditional requirements in context

### Medium Priority

1. **Improve Accessibility**
   - Add comprehensive ARIA labels
   - Implement screen reader announcements
   - Test with accessibility tools

2. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement loading indicators
   - Add performance metrics
   - Optimize large components

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Better recovery from corrupted URL state
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Validation summary before XML generation

### Low Priority

1. **Add Development Tools**
   - URL state debugger for production
   - Better logging for debugging
   - Component performance profiler

2. **Improve Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
   - Document business rules inline
   - Create user guide

## 5. Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Missing conditional validation rules could lead to invalid XML submissions
- Incomplete keyboard navigation affects accessibility compliance
- No XSD validation before download could result in invalid XML files

### Medium Risk
- Performance issues with large forms could impact user experience
- Limited error recovery might frustrate users
- Missing help text increases support burden

### Low Risk
- Minor UI inconsistencies
- Development-only features missing

## 6. Conclusion

The SII XML Energy Offer Generator implementation demonstrates solid engineering with a well-structured codebase and comprehensive validation. The core functionality is complete and functional. However, several requirements from the PRD remain unimplemented or partially implemented, particularly around conditional field logic, accessibility, and user assistance features.

**Recommendation**: Address high-priority items before production release, especially the conditional validation rules and file naming issues that directly impact SII compliance.
