2. **XML Validation Not Implemented** - Cannot verify output
3. **File Download Not Implemented** - Cannot export results

### Medium Priority (Functional Gaps):
1. Complex validation rules missing in several steps
2. Weekly time band format validation
3. Component interval count validation
4. Range validations for consumption/power

### Low Priority (Enhancements):
1. Integration tests missing
2. Some edge case validations

## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Implement XML Generation** (Priority 1)
   - Create XML builder with proper structure
   - Follow SII specification exactly
   - Implement file naming convention

2. **Implement Missing Validations** (Priority 2)
   - Weekly time band format validation
   - Component interval rules
   - Range validations
   - Date-based restrictions

3. **Complete File Operations** (Priority 3)
   - XML preview functionality
   - File download with proper naming
   - XSD validation

### Estimated Completion Time:
- XML Generation: 3-4 days
- Validation Fixes: 2-3 days
- File Operations: 1-2 days
- Testing: 2-3 days

**Total: 8-12 days to production-ready**

## 9. Live Testing Results

During the analysis, I performed live testing using Playwright to verify the findings:

### Tests Performed:
1. **URL State Persistence**: ✅ Confirmed - Form data is correctly encoded in URL parameters
2. **Step Navigation**: ✅ Working - Steps can be navigated using the stepper
3. **Conditional Logic - Market Type**: ✅ Working - "Single Offer" field correctly hidden when "Dual Fuel" selected
4. **Conditional Logic - Client Type**: ✅ Working - "Residential Status" field correctly appears when "Domestico" selected
5. **Form Validation**: ✅ Working - Fields accept valid input and transform to uppercase where required
6. **Italian Localization**: ✅ Complete - All labels and UI elements are in Italian

### Testing Limitations:
- Could not test XML generation as feature is not implemented
- Could not navigate to final step without completing all required fields
- Did not test all validation edge cases

## 10. Conclusion

The project has made significant progress with all UI components and basic functionality implemented. The conditional logic and state management work correctly as verified through live testing. However, the core XML generation feature is completely missing, making the application non-functional for its primary purpose. 

The implementation quality of completed features is high, with good test coverage, proper Italian localization, and working conditional logic. The URL state persistence works as expected, allowing form data to be preserved across navigation.

To reach production readiness, the team must focus on:
1. Implementing the XML generation pipeline
2. Adding the missing complex validation rules
3. Completing the file download functionality

Once these critical features are implemented, the application will meet all PRD requirements and be ready for deployment.
